# DSMR-reader-import
Import of records in CSV format from Domoticz to DSMR_reader (https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Main_Page and https://github.com/dsmrreader) or other sources.

Domoticz uses 2 tables one for the Gas meter readings, the other for the 4 counters from the Electricity.
The CSV file format can be used for other soures also, I included 2 examples
And add extra meter readings to DSMR 

# Background
I started working on 2 existing scripts, python and windows scripting.
Both sources I used in my python version of the  script: why another one?
Windows is not my thing ;) The python version is ok but it requires quite a bit of data fiddling. Both not optimal

# How does it work?
- Read CSV structure,
- filter on the 2 indexes for the meters
- Remove redundant columns
- Merge electricity and gas measurements
- import via the API

Try it first with 1 date and then everything else

# The steps
Disclaimer: Although it worked out perfectly, please use a test setup or try it out first with a limited set of data ;)

    1. Export Domoticz Database (via backup database)
    2. Export multimeter_calendar. and meter_calendar as CSV with a comma as separator
    3. Place the 2 files in the same directory as the python script: rename them or edit the script
    4. pip install pandas (takes care of the operations on the CSV files)
    5. Add your dsmreader APi key (enable the API) and the Index numbers of the Gas and electricity meters from Domoticz
    6. sudo supervisorctl stop dsm_backend and dsmr_datalogger
    7. Run the script
    8. sudo supervisorctl start all
    9. ./manage.py dsmr_stats_reconstruct_missing_day_statistics (and prices also if needed)
    10. check the data you imported, just to be sure
